    <p>We met in school! Nope we aren't highschool sweet hearts more like college lovers. 
        I do say lovers since she stole my breath at first sight in my english class!
        She was sitting all the way in the back of the classroom when I saw her with here red
        hair and blue coat just sitting there, I guess I took to long admiring her beauty 
        because as I took that first step forward to sit next to here some random dude takes
        the seat next to her!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Welp I thought that was it, it wasn't ment to be oh well i'll just move on with my 
        life. That wasn't the end of it though, as I go to my next class I come in through
        the back door and I see her again sitting down and the seat next to here is empty so 
        I make a run for it! As well as one can run in a classroom, that little stunt led to 
        me tripping and stumbling. Lucky for me she didn't see that... but the guy sitting 
        behind her totaly did I remember his words to this day "Smooth man"... yeah it was 
        worth it though. Thanks for those encouraging words Jordan!!! Smooth all the way my 
        guy.
    </p>
    <p>The best part was when I introduced myself and she looked back at me with a look of 
        "Why the hell is this guy talking to me?". Turns out that I was right but because of
        brave guys in Idaho Introducing them selves to cute girls.
    </p>
    <p>But from here is where the fun beggins!</p>
