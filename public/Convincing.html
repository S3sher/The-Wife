            Well from classroom to dating you can only go up from here if you put in the 
            effort and boy did I do that.

            Taking her out was all the rave in this relationship (see what I did there?(wordplay)),
            the amout of fun that we had was great taking here out to dance was fun even though my 
            dancing skills kinda suck.

            But to be honest the best fun was always the simple silly experiences that I had with her.
            Simple is best... sometimes.
